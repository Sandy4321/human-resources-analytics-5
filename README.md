# Human Resources Analytics

This is just a dataset I found on Kaggle, linked [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ludobenistant/hr-analytics/version/2).  I thought it would be an interesting to investigate this dataset and to practice my Machine Learning skills.

## Description

Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely?  Have fun with this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next.  

## Data 

Fields in this dataset include:

- Last evaluation
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time spent at the company
- Whether they have had a work accident
- Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
- Department
- Salary
- Whether the employee has left
